He was dragged off brutally and violently. Blood is visible on his face and body. The flight was departing O'Hare Interntaional Airport in Chicago for Louisville, Kentucky.
The passenger explained that he is a doctor and he is on his way to see his patients thus he cannot reschedule his flight. This resulted in him being forcefully dragged off the plane and the force deployed caused him to bleed. 
The passenger was shouting that he was chosen to leave the flight only because he is Chinese, according to the news report by the New York Times.

Deport Kayak Killer Angelika Graswald,"Created by L.L. on July 26, 2017","Angelika Graswald pleaded guilty to killing her fiancé Vincent Viafore in 2015 by sabotaging his kayak during a trip on the Hudson River. Prosecutors said she was charged with negligent homicide for pulling the plug on Viafore's kayak leading to his death by drowning.
Graswald, 37, admitted she knew Viafore was not wearing a life vest and that the locking clip to his paddle was missing, Orange County District Attorney David Hoovler's office said in a statement. Following the incident, which took place April 19, 2015, Graswald lodged a missing report for her husband-to-be. The victim's body was later recovered from the river, about 50 miles north of New York City.
Graswald will be sentenced on Nov. 1. Deport this menace!!

Force Venezuela to free US citizen and political prisoner Carlos Avendaño!,"Created by M.S. on July 30, 2017","On Saturday,  July 29, 2017, American citizen Carlos Avendaño stepped out of his home in Maracaibo to observe anti-government protests directly outside his building. Despite his efforts not to take part in the activity, Carlos was arbitrarily detained by security forces and has been denied contact with his five-year-old daughter and his wife who is four months pregnant. The Venezuelan authorities have charges of terrorism and other fabrications in virtue of Carlos's US citizenship. Carlos is a professor of analytic chemistry with no criminal record or history of political activity, and his politically-motivated detention is a human rights violation of the highest order. We the people are asking the White House to use any and all means to ensure the safe release of this American citizen.

Impeach Judge Gloria M. Navarro,"Created by K.H. on August 14, 2017","We the People of the United States petition the U.S. House of Representatives to impeach Judge Gloria M. Navarro of the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada for committing treason and collaborating in the insurrection against the Constitutional authority of the federal government.
Even more so, Judge Navarro is now prohibiting the defendant in the Bunkerville standoff retrial, Eric Parker, from testifying in his own behalf, as well as calling witnesses to testify in his own behalf . Judge Navarro has violated the 6th Amendment of the United States Constitution and is denying Eric Parker his right to due process. 
We as American citizens have all pledged for ""liberty and justice for ALL."" We must all stand for justice and a fair trial, no matter the crime committed.

Add renal cell carcinoma to list of presumptively connected diseases - Agent Orange and pesticides exposure in Vietnam.,"Created by T.S. on July 31, 2017","There are currently 14 conditions listed in the VA regulations that are automatically assumed to be connect to Agent Orange exposure during military service in Vietnam and to a limited extent in Thailand (although that limitation should be eliminated as well).  Currently renal cell carcinoma is not included.  There are thousands of veterans suffering from this disease who were exposed in SE Asia.  They need relief for themselves and their widows.  Add this disease to the list of those assumed to be connected to Agent Orange and pesticides.

Reduce the requirements for transgender individuals to change their legal gender,"Created by A.C. on July 22, 2017","I am a female-to-male (FtM) transgender individual who has been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for over a year and a half. I was recently able to change my legal name and was looking into changing my gender marker as well. Unfortunately, in the state of Illinois, one is not allowed to do so unless they have proof of some kind of surgery.
Not only is surgery extremely expensive, not all transgender people want to have it, and a law like this bars the path for people who want to have their legal documents reflect who they are.
Each state has a different law regarding changing your gender as well, making the process even more difficult. Therefore, I'd like to request that the federal government reduce the requirements in all states to simply having proof that you are on HRT.
